# Student Score Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Simple Linear Regression** to predict a student's score based on the number of hours studied.  
It is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project implemented using **Python** and common data science libraries.

The objective is to understand:
- The relationship between study hours and exam scores
- How linear regression works in a real-world scenario
- Basic steps in a Machine Learning workflow
